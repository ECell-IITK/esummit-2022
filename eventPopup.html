    <h4>Be An Angel</h4>
    <p>
      Pitching your idea to a group of investors is incredibly
      nerve-wracking.You wonder if they’ll like your idea. You wonder if they’ll
      like you. Most of all, one wonders if they’re going to fund you or not.
      Even if one has money in the bank, there’s going to come a point when one
      simply has to get additional funding to grow their startup and start
      scaling up. So we bring to you a competition that will actually put you in
      the shoes of investors thereby teaching you a lot about what investors
      want and how to position the companies for successful pitches in the
      future. Students participating here are the investors, not the
      entrepreneurs. They do not have to come with startup ideas. Rather, they
      would play the role of Angel Investors/Analysts in a VC firm assessing the
      startups being posed to them as potential investments.
